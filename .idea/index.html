            <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>
                Our client is Mike Van Doren, Chief Product Officer of Lipinski Web Design, which is in the business
                of licensing enterprise software solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                For a  number of years, Mike has been aware of an unsolved problem in the software sales field.
                There currently exists no integrated solution for management of the pre-sales workforce in enterprise
                sales departments. Our client has asked us to develop this solution for his company to market.
            </p>

            <p>
                In enterprise software marketing, the pre-sales team is responsible for demonstrating the software
                which is being marketed. While working on a prospective sale, a sales representative may request the
                services of the pre-sales team multiple times, and potentially for multiple products throughout the
                process. There is currently no software solution on the market for the scheduling of these demonstrations
                which meets the needs of our client.

                <h3>This service must:</h3>
                <li>Allow sales representatives to request a pre-sales team member</li>
                <l1>Allow pre-sales team management to schedule pre-sales operations</l1>
                <li>Simplify selecting the most qualified pre-sales team member to work a given operation</li>
                <li>Track pre-sales team member customer relationships</li>
                <li>Obtain reporting on pre-sales metrics</li>

            <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p>
                This project aims to solve the client's problem by developing a web service which is integrated with
                Salesforce through an API. Our service will provide the logic for the various operations described in the
                project scope, and store related data into a database.

            <h2>Project Highlights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There is currently no other product on the market which solves the problem which this project aims
                    to solve.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Building our database and logic into a standalone web service outside of Salesforce's ecosystem provides
                    both modularity and scalability. This app should be compatible with any existing Salesforce org which
                    by using only standard Salesforce objects, and exporting the logic and specifically related data
                    to our own server.

                    <h3>Sprint 1</h3>
                    <p>
                        We had our first team meeting with the client, and developed a business event table and context
                        diagram for the project.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Sprint 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        We developed a prototype UI in Figma, and reviewed it with our client. Screenshots of the prototype
                        are displayed above.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Sprint 3</h3>
                    <p>
                        We developed a proof of concept for all technologies we anticipate using in developing this project.
                        Altogether we created a basic Salesforce Lightning application, a Django backend application,
                        and a SSO login page written using Angular.js.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <l1>
                    <h3>Sprint 4</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was our first development iteration. We produced a very basic skeleton Salesforce Lighting
                        application which provides a pre-sales request form, and sends an http POST request with the information
                        collected in the form. We also developed a Django application and database with the bare-minimum
                        information contained in a pre-sales request.
